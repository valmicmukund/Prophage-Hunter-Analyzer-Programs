# Prophage-Hunter-Analyzer-Programs
A folder containing program(s) that take in a whole genome .fasta sequence input to Prophage Hunter and the main Prophage Hunter output and return a new .txt file with summarized information from both files

ProphageHunterAnalyzer.py
After running Prophage Hunter on a whole genome sequence, use this program to create a .txt file that lists the strain name, candidate number, and phage status (active, ambiguous) of found phages. The program takes in the file directory of a folder containing 'sequence' and 'output' files - referring to the input whole genome .fasta sequence and Main_output.txt from Prophage Hunter, respectively. Whole genome sequence inputs only. Only ambiguous and active phages are reported by this program currently.
